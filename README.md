## Reflections On Every Assignments/Projects
🖥️ **_Technology & Information System_**
1. <ins>Overview of ICT Jobs In Industry</ins>

   From this assignment, I learned the way to filter information and arrange all the useful information inside a poster systematically to create a stronger visual impact and easier-to-understand
   poster. I get information from my group members and filter necessary information to be inserted in the poster. Arrangement of all the information is a big challenge for me since the 
   information needed is a lot and the spaces available is only an A4 paper. Due to this problem, I used Pinterest to search some examples of imformative poster as inspiration. Then the result 
   turns out well. From this, I learned that how important it is to learn from others to make up for my own shortcomings.

2. <ins>PC Assemble Lab</ins>
  
   This lab let me know that I have to absorb all the knowledges on the spot and apply them right after it. It is a must to listen to the lesson carefuly and be fully concentrate. So, that you can 
   make sure that you gained the knowledge taught 100%. Not only that, the importance to have strong hands-on ability is also the crucial point I gained from this lab. No matter how solid your 
   theoretical knowledge is，with weak hands-on ability, it's just nothing. 

3. <ins>Design Thinking: MedLink System Integrated APP</ins>

   This is the first big project that related to technology I conducted with my group members. This project forces me to trigger my creativity to produce an attractive idea to be adopted. Before coming up with an actual 
   plan for my idea, I did a lot of research to ensure that the idea can be implemented in reality, but not just by imagination. I have to confirm that it is a thing that has a market in Malaysia, and people really need 
   it to solve their daily life problems. An understanding of the big issue faced by people is the key point to make this a successful project. During the process of this project, we met a lot of difficulties. Once a 
   problem is solved, another will appear. This alerts me to how important it is to think about everything thoroughly. It is very important to have an efficient discussion among all the group members to do such a big 
   project in a group. When there are more than 2 people in a gourp, there will be a lot of ideas with different sights, to reach an agreement is the first challenge we face. In our group, everyone has a chance to 
   persuade the others, we have to show the advantages and disadvantages of our ideas. Even though we had a small conflict in between reaching an agreement, we resolved it pretty well by voting fairly.

**<ins>In Summary</ins>**
 
As I mentioned above, I learned a lot from this course. For example, the way to filter information, hands-one ability, effective discussion with group members, and knowledge absorption on the spot. Every assignments 
or projects of this course are vary. The tasks we have to face are different as well and it is very interesting in exploring various fields. It is a fun course because it allows us to experience lots of different 
stuffs like the PC Assemble Lab, poster designing, and idea generation. During this course, we have lots of chance to interact with the international students, since basically we have in-class activities every weeks 
in group.

If there is any improvement that I have to suggest, it will only be more theoretical lessons are needed. Due to the in-class activities that may take the whole class' hours, our class is lacks of theoretical lesson.
A balance between theoretical lessons and in-class activities need to be maintain. 

🧮 **_Discrete Structure_**

   Assignments of Discrete Structure taught me that before submitting any assignments or projects, we must check it at least 3 times with eyes open widely. Due to the mentality of luck, we just check our answers roughly 
   and our Assignment 1 (Chapter 1.1 to 2.2) turns out that we have more than a careless mistake. However, the submission is due, no more edit and re-submission are allowed. This had give me a lesson that wishful 
   thinking has to be avoided  and we have to pay 100% of concentration in doing everything. Other than that, these assignments also helps me has a deeper understanding towards this course since I will do extra online 
   self learning to done them. Also they help me to improve my logical thinking skills and analysis skills on questions or difficulties. The main thing I gained from this course is that it is important to do self- 
   improvement or self-learning to have a better understanding.

   Improvement that can be done of this course is that there is too little of tricky questions provided for us to try. Most of the tasks given in class or through e-learning are mostly basic or average hard level. Tricky 
   questions are one of the tool that can force us to think about the logic behind every mathematic calculation or the answers. If we only do basic questions or questions with moderate hard level, we can't get any 
   improvement. Hence, our standard can't be elevated.
